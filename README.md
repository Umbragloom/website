# #My personal website!~

README for my personal static website built on the Hugo Framework, utilizing
a fantastic custom Terminal Theme, dynamically updated from Github with
Netlify, and the ability for posting remotely with the Netlify CMS. I post
tutorials and projects. 

Will update with some more info later. Updating to test of this works from Termux too.
