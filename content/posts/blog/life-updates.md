# Life Updates
----

Quick update as its been almost a year since i was in the hospital.

1. Heart failure has become manageable. 
2. I have changed my diet. I eat a mostly whole- food plant based diet.
       I do still eat meat once in a while (maybe 2-3 times a month) but on
       average its a WFPB diet. This is also as a Low sodium (less than 1500mg
       a day, no more than 2900mg a day, unless its a special instance that
       I will change me day before and day after to accomodate the increase.)
       as low sugar as possible , and very minimal amounts of oils. 
3. I have greatly increased my exercise, trying for 10K steps a day, as
       well as 30-45 min of moderately intense exercise 3-5 days a week. 
4. I have lost nearly 50 lbs since my hospital visit.
5. I have gotten my BP under control and have increased my EF (Ejection
       Fraction) from sub 20% to 45%. Still not to the recommended 55-65%, but feel
       significantly better. 

6. I have learned to enjoy my life much more. Knowing that i have a diesese
   that can be possibly reversed, or at least managed for the long term, i have
   acknowledged that life is short, and can change at any moment, and that it
   needs to be enjoyed. 

Overall my cardiologist believes I can make a great recovery and get my heart
back up to the healthy level it needs to be.
