  Engineering Technology, with a major focus in Electronics Design and
  Integrations at Daytona State College.

  - Looking to get my Linux+, CCNA, Network+, and CompTIA A+ sometime in the
    future.  
- I prefer FOSS (Free Open Source Software), such as:
[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), [Krita](https://krita.org/en/),
[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) and [KiCad](https://kicad-pcb.org/)
